Unfortunately we couldn't integrate the text in with the torus/basketball,
please excuse this inconvenience and we would be grateful if we can receive any marks
for the work done for the text portion.

Assuming the operating system is windowns, 
run the makefile normally and enter "text" afterwards instead of "main"
The makefile will compile the text portion into "text.exe"

Also attaching a screenshot incase, it does not work!

THE TEXT WAS DONE IN 3D!
