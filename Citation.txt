Type: Graphics Torus Sample Code
Link: https://www.codemiles.com/c-opengl-examples/drawing-torus-using-opengl-t9014.html
This is a sample torus code written by msi_333, which uses an inbuilt torus
function (glutSolidTorus). This gave an idea on how to create the torus
without using equations since we failed to create one the other way.

Title: light.c
Type: Opengl lighting model
Link: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep557/06au/tools/OpenGL/light.c
We did not use this source to do the lighting effect, it was infact a youtube video.
However upon further research, i found out that the code was originally written
by Silicon Graphics, Inc. We have used the myinit(void) function from
this site to create the lighting effect on the torus!
