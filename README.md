# GraphicsProject

Initially our main project folder was base project. The other folders are all work we tried inorder to get the logo, by implementing this project in parts. We tried to get the obj file for a torus manually but failed. We tried to generate a torus using a UVTorus file with mesh, the math attempts for that are in the UVTorus.cpp file under the TorusGeneration folder. Ultimately making the torus manually did not work. Our goal was to use this obj file and scale the sphere and torus for the raptors logo as its base. This failed and we even tried to get an obj file compatible but still failed. Due to circumstances we used a built in function to generate the torus. The code for manually integrating two objects in one model view is in base project. This took time to get it working. 

The "TextPotion-TORONTO_RAPTORS" folder contains the text that we tried to integrate into the main project which did not end up working. Currently the program is ran through the "RaptorsLogo-MAIN" folder. 

"RaptorsLogo-MAIN" folder has a sphere which spins and a torus which rotates in z axis, also few lighting tweaks were done on the torus.

"TextPotion-TORONTO_RAPTORS" contains text which we failed to integrate with the main logo. The text was meant to be placed on top of the torus in a curve formation resembling the actual raptors logo.

Part marks for all that work would be trully appreciated. Thank you!
